# TS Practice

## Array Methods Exercises

1. Filter products by a specific category.
2. Map out a catalog with just the name and price.
3. Reduce the catalog to the total price of all products.
4. Write a function that takes in the catalog and a category, filters by category and then returns the total price of all products in that category.

## Promise Exercises

1. Create a function that fetches data from an API using Promises. The function should accept a URL as a parameter and return a Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.
1. Use the function to fetch data from a [sample API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1) and log the result.
1. Modify the function to use async/await syntax instead of .then() and .catch().

If by chance you finish all of these exercises, write the tests!
